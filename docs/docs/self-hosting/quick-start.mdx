# ðŸš€ Quick Start & Trial

Whether you have a licence ([you can buy one here](https://app.retrospected.com/subscribe)) or want to **trial** Retrospected, you will be running in no time.

This will guide you through a local (a.k.a **self hosted**) installation of Retrospected.

:::info Prior knowledge
This quick start guide assumes you have a basic knowledge of Docker and Docker-Compose, and that they are both installed in your system.
If you need more detailed instructions, please [read this guide](./prerequisites).
:::


## 1 - Create a Docker-Compose file

Create your own customised docker-compose file, using the editor below.

:::tip What about security?
All passwords in this page are generated, **randomly**, **on your browser**.<br />
None of them are known to anyone except you. They are stored in [local storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) so they are not lost if you reload this page.
You are of course welcome to change them.

Passwords (and other fields) are restricted to **alphanumeric characters** (plus "-", "@", "_", "."), to avoid issues with environement variables and escaping.
:::

<Editor />

:::info Might not be localhost...
If you installed and ran your Retrospected docker-compose file on a
different machine than localhost, you'll need to replace "localhost" by
your machine name of course.
:::

:::danger About passwords....
Once you have run your docker-compose file for the first time, some of
the passwords will be set in stone. Please refrain from changing them
going forward, or if you must, read the
[following guide](passwords).

Retrospected & PGAdmin are now running!
