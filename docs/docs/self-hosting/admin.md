# Admin Panel

When self-hosting, you will not have access to the ability to confirm and reset passwords by email.

If a user forgets their password, you can access a specific admin tool by accessing `/admin` on your Retrospected frontend, and reset your user's password.

:::tip Admin Only!
Only the admin user set under `SELF_HOSTED_ADMIN` in your `docker-compose.yml` file will be able to access this page.

The admin panel should look like this:
