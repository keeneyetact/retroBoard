# ðŸ“§ Sendgrid

By default, and when using the basic configuration in the [quick-start](quick-start) page, 
your users will be able to register using an email without having to verify that email.

It also means they **won't be able to change their password if they forget it**.

You have two ways of solving this problem:
- Use the [Admin Panel](admin), if you are the admin, to manually change someone else's password
- Setup Sendgrid so that emails are verified, and recovery emails are sent if a user forgets their password

The latter is what we are going to setup in this guide.

:::info Is it free?
Sendgrid is completely free up to a certain amount of emails per day. For a self-hosted instance, you are very
unlikely to have to pay for it.

### Get an account and API keys

- Go to Sendgrid's [signup page](https://signup.sendgrid.com) and register
- On your account dashboard, go to `Settings` then `API Keys` and finally `Create API Key`
- Choose a name, then `Restricted Access` and toggle `Mail Send > Mail Send` (see below)<br />

- Click create, and then copy the key that you've created somewhere safe (we'll need it later)

### Create the templates

We will need to create two templates, one for the verification email (the one sent after registration), 
and the other one for the password reset email.

- Go to `Email API` and `Dynamic Templates`
- Click on `Create a Dynamic Template`, and name it `Verification Email`
- On the created template, click on `Add Version`
- Select the blank template, and then the `Design Editor`
- Add a Text field, and add the following content:
```
Hello {{name}}!

Please click on the email below to validate your email and start using Retrospected right away.

{{domain}}/validate?email={{email}}&code={{code}}
```
- Then save
- Create another dynamic template, this time named `Reset Password Email`, create a new version, blank template and Design Editor
- Add a Text field and add the following content:
```
Hi {{name}},

To reset your password, follow the link:

{{domain}}/reset?email={{email}}&code={{code}}
```
- Click save. You should now have two templates, with one version each, like this:
<img src="/img/self-hosting/sendgrid-3.png" width="600" />
- Within each template, you have a `Template ID`: copy the two of them (one for each template), we'll need them later.


### Set the environement variables

We should now have all the information we need.
In the `backend` section of your `docker-compose.yml` file, add the following variables:
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY`: this is the API key you got in the first section of this guide
- `SENDGRID_SENDER`: enter the email you used to create your Sendgrid account
- `SENDGRID_VERIFICATION_EMAIL_TID`: this is the **Template ID** you created in the second section of this guide, for the **verification email**.
- `SENDGRID_RESET_PASSWORD_TID`: this is the **Template ID** you created in the second section of this guide, for the **password reset email**.
- `BASE_URL`: this is the URL to your self-hosted Retrospected (for example: `http://retro.mycompany.com`)

### Done!

Now that it is setup, your users should now need to verify their email and will be able to reset their passwords themselves.
