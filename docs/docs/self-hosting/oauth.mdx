# üîê OAuth

On the public [Retrospected](https://app.retrospected.com) website, 
you will have noticed that people can register and login in one click using an OAuth provider:

You can provide the same seamless experience on your Self-Hosted instance by following the guide below.

:::tip Local Network
The following works even if you are self-hosting on a local or corporate network. Your instance doesn't have to
be reachable over the internet.
:::

:::info What about other providers?
We will help you set up OAuth for **Google** and **Github**, but the process is similar for the other 
providers we support: **Okta**, **Microsoft**, **Twitter** and **Slack**.

## Common setup

In order for OAuth to work, you need to setup the `BASE_URL` environement variable on your docker-compose file:
this is the URL to your self-hosted Retrospected (for example: `http://retro.mycompany.com`).

Look [here](optionals) in the full docker-compose file to get an example.


## Github

If you are working in tech, chances are your users will have a GitHub account.

To setup OAuth for GitHub, follow the guide:

### Create the keys

- Go to your [GitHub profile](https://github.com/settings/profile) (you need to be logged in)
- On the left-hand-side, find the `Developer settings` menu:<br />

- Select `OAuth Apps`<br />
<img src="/img/self-hosting/oa-github-2.png" width="200" />
- Fill the following information:
  - **Application name**: A name that you choose
  - **Home page URL**: the publicly reachable URL for your instance of Retrospected
  - **Description**: Some description of your choosing
  - **Authorization callback URL**: This is the most important: it is composed of the domain followed by `/api/auth/github/callback`.<br />

- Click `Register Application`
- Your app is now created, and you need to now click on `Generate a new client secret`. The page should now look like this:<br />
<img src="/img/self-hosting/oa-github-4.png" width="400" />

### Install the keys
- Copy both the `Client ID` and the `Client Secret` from the form above
- In your `docker-compose.yml` file, set them up respectively as `GITHUB_KEY` and `GITHUB_SECRET` in the backend section. [Look here](optionals) if you are not sure where these should be.
- Restart your containers (`docker-compose up -d`) and you should now be able to use GitHub to login üéâ.


## Google

### Create the keys

- Connect to the [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard) dashboard
- Create a new Project (if you don't have one already)<br />
<img src="/img/self-hosting/oa-gcp-1.png" width="600" /><br />
<img src="/img/self-hosting/oa-gcp-2.png" width="300" />
- Then select this new project (in the page header), and go to `APIs and services` and `Credentials`<br />
<img src="/img/self-hosting/oa-gcp-3.png" width="400" />
- Fill the `OAuth Consent Screen` information<br />
<img src="/img/self-hosting/oa-gcp-4.png" width="400" />
- Then go back to `Credentials`, click on `Create Credentials` then `OAuth client ID`.<br />
<img src="/img/self-hosting/oa-gcp-5.png" width="400" />
- Fill the relevant information, the important bit here will be the `Authorised Redirect URL`. It is composed of the domain followed by `/api/auth/google/callback`.<br />
<img src="/img/self-hosting/oa-gcp-6.png" width="400" />
- You will then finally given two keys:<br />

### Install the keys

- Copy both the `Your Client ID` and the `Your Client Secret` from the form above
- In your `docker-compose.yml` file, set them up respectively as `GOOGLE_KEY` and `GOOGLE_SECRET` in the backend section. [Look here](optionals) if you are not sure where these should be.
- Restart your containers (`docker-compose up -d`) and you should now be able to use Google to login üéâ.
