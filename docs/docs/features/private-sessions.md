# Private Sessions

:::info Pro Feature
This feature is a Pro feature.

## What is it for?

By default, a session is accessible to anyone as long as they have the full URL.

You can always rely on [security through obscurity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity) and make sure you are not sharing the URL to anyone outside of your team, but that's of course not ideal.

Private Sessions are then a way to lock a session to the users who already accessed it, preventing access to anyone else.

## How does it work?

Start a session as usual, and once all the participants have joined, click on the "Make Private" button:

You will then see a list of all participants, and only these participants will be allowed access to the session in the future.
