# retro-board

This is a Retrospective Idea board, powering [retrospected.com](http://www.retrospected.com).

![Retrospected.com](/content/screenshot.png?raw=true "Retrospected.com")

It features the following technologies:

* React
* Redux
* Socket IO
* Webpack
* Hot-reloading
* Material UI design
* Modular CSS
* redux-saga
* Multilingual / Internationalization


## How to run for production

* Clone this repository
* `npm i` to install the dependencies (Node 4+, NPM 3+)
* `npm run build` to build everything (client and server)
* `NODE_ENV=production PORT=8080 node index.js` to run the server on port 8080


## How to run for development

* Clone this repository
* `npm i` to install the dependencies (Node 4+, NPM 3+)
* Open another terminal (you need two of those)
* `npm run start-server` on the first terminal to start the server bit
* `npm run start-ui` on the second terminal, to run live webpack with hot-reload
* Open your browser on [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)


## How to use Google Analytics

By default, Google Analytics is deactivated (it doesn't even get build into the bundle).

To enable it, create a configuration file by copying `/config/configuration_template.json` to `/config/configuration.json`, and set it up by pasting your GA tracking ID, and setting the other setting to true, then rebuild.

Note: Google Analytics only works when using the production webpack config.


## Roadmap

* Persistence: Improve by using MongoDB (or not, this is still in debate)
* Add more languages
