## How to try it out 🚀

You must have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed on your system.

- Clone this repository
- Then run `docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.example.yml up -d`.
- Open your browser on [http://localhost](http://localhost)
- _(then please wait a few minutes the first time for the database to initialise)_

## How to run for development 📝

### Prerequisites 💿

- You must have [docker](https://www.docker.com) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed on your system.
- You must also have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), version 15 (other recent versions will probably work too).
- `Yarn`: Please install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), as this mono-repo uses **Yarn Workspaces** which won't work with NPM.

### Run 🚀

- Clone this repository
- Run Postgres, Redis, PGAdmin locally:
  - `cd ./retro-board/retro-board` (that is the `retro-board` directory within the repository)
  - `docker-compose up -d`
  - `cd ..`
- `yarn` to install the dependencies (_not_ `npm i`!)
- `yarn build-common` to build the shared module
- `yarn migrate` to run the database migrations
- `yarn start-server` to start the backend
- Open another terminal
- `yarn start-ui` on the second terminal to run the UI
- Open your browser on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## How to run for Production using Docker 🐳

### Prerequisites 💿

- You must obtain a self-hosting licence, please contact support@retrospected.com to get one.
- You must have [docker](https://www.docker.com) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed on your system.

### Run 🚀

- Copy `docker-compose.example.yml` to `docker-compose.yml`
- Edit `docker-compose.yml` to change credentials and secrets
- _Optional: for ARM-based systems, use biarms/pgadmin4 instead_
- Run `docker-compose up -d`
- Voilà!

This will run a production-ready version of Retrospected automatically, using Postgres and Redis. You don't need to have anything installed other than Docker. This will install and run:

- Postgres
- pgAdmin4 (Web UI for postgres)
- Redis
- The Retrospected Node.js Backend
- The Retrospected React Frontend, served by `nginx`.

## How to run for Production using Kubernetes ☸

Please read the [readme](/k8s/readme.md) file in the `k8s` folder. Please note: Kubernetes
example configs are not maintained, and are only provided as an example.

## Backups 💾

When using the Docker deployment, your database runs from a container. But if you still need to make some backup of your data, you can do the following:

- Get the docker database container ID by doing: `docker ps`
- Run `` docker exec -t <docker_container_id> pg_dumpall -c -U postgres > dump_`date +%d-%m-%Y"_"%H_%M\_%S`.sql ``
- To restore your databases: `cat dump_1234.sql | docker exec -i <docker_container_id> psql -U postgres`

## How to run the tests ✅

- Clone this repository
- `yarn` to install the dependencies (_not_ `npm i`!)
- `yarn test` to run the tests in watch mode
- **or** `yarn ci-test` to run the tests once

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### What if I want to name my session so I can remember easily how to come back to it?

You can actually change the session ID in the URL with anything you like: for example [www.retrospected.com/game/hello_world](http://www.retrospected.com/game/hello_world)

Try not to take a too common name though, to avoid anyone else finding your session by chance.
