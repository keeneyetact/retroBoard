## How to run for production (or to try it out)

* Clone this repository
* `yarn` to install the dependencies (or `npm i`) (Node 4+, NPM 3+)
* `npm run build` to build everything (client and server)
* `npm start` to run the server on port 8080
* Open your browser on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)


## How to run for development

* Clone this repository
* `yarn` to install the dependencies (or `npm i`) (Node 4+, NPM 3+)
* Open another terminal (you need two of those)
* `npm run start-server` on the first terminal to start the server bit
* `npm run start-ui` on the second terminal, to run live webpack with hot-reload
* Open your browser on [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)


## How to run the tests

* Clone this repository
* `yarn` to install the dependencies (or `npm i`) (Node 4+, NPM 3+)
* `npm test` to run the tests
* **or** `npm run test-watch` to run the tests every time you change a file


## How to use Google Analytics

By default, Google Analytics is deactivated (it doesn't even get built into the bundle).

To enable it, create a configuration file by copying `/config/configuration_template.json` to `/config/configuration.json`, and set it up by pasting your GA tracking ID, and setting the other setting to true, then rebuild.

Note: Google Analytics only works when using the production webpack config.


## How to use MongoDB

By default, the database engine is NeDB, an in-process database with no external dependencies (i.e. no database to install on your system).

If you want to use a more "production-ready" database such as MongoDB, create the configuration file as explained above and set `DB_Use_Mongo` to `true`. You will of course need an instance of MongoDB running on your system for that to work.


## How to debug

### Debugging the server

* Run `npm run start-server-debug`
* Don't forget to start the client side as well `npm run start-ui`
* A Chrome Dev tool will open, wait a bit until it finishes loading
* It will break at the first line of code, so once it's there, click continue
* Then wait a bit (could be 20-30 seconds) for the code to run and the server to work properly
* From now on, you can set up a breakpoint anywhere in the Chrome Dev tools and it should work.
* Happy debugging!

### Debugging the client

* Run both client and server normally (`npm run start-server` and `npm run start-ui`)
* From the browser window where the website is open, open the Chrome Dev tools
* Go on the **Sources** tab, and on the left, find your sources under `webpack://` and then `.`.
* You can then put breakpoints in there and debugging


## Roadmap

* Add more languages
* GraphQL

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### What if I want to name my session so I can remember easily how to come back to it?

You can actually change the session ID in the URL with anything you like: for example [www.retrospected.com/session/hello_world](http://www.retrospected.com/session/hello_world)

Try not to take a too common name though, to avoid anyone else finding your session by chance.

You can also use the "Advanced" tab when creating a session, and provide a name.

I'm especially looking for a German translation.

Special thanks to [@andresin87](https://github.com/andresin87) for pointing the `flag-icon-css` package to me, it replaces the PNG flags in a neater way.

Please make your PRs from the **develop** branch, not **master**.
