# retro-board

This is a Retrospective Idea board, powering [retrospected.com](http://www.retrospected.com).

![Retrospected.com](/content/screenshot-v2.png?raw=true 'Retrospected.com')

This project is both an actual product, and also a technology demo using the latest and greatest JavaScript/TypeScript libraries of the month.

It features the following technologies:

- [React 16](https://github.com/facebook/react)
- [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
- [React Router 4](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
- [Mono Repo / Yarn Workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Hot-reloading](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader)
- [Socket IO](http://socket.io)
- [Webpack 4](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) (See older versions for Webpack 1, 2 and 3)
- [Material UI design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html)
- [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/)
- [Multilingual](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33413880/react-redux-and-multilingual-internationalization-apps-architecture) / Internationalization
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) (optional), defaults to [NeDB](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb) (in-process)
- [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest) for Unit Testing
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro), for Integration Tests
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), replacing NPM
- [Docker](https://docker.com), for easy deployment

Previous versions, up to v1.0.1 featured the following libraries:

- ~~[Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)~~
- ~~[CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)~~
- ~~[redux-saga](https://github.com/yelouafi/redux-saga)~~
- ~~[reselect](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect)~~
- ~~[ESLint](http://eslint.org/) for JS and JSX~~

## Prerequisites

- `Yarn`: Please install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), as this mono-repo uses **Yarn Workspaces** which won't work with NPM.

## How to try it out (Mac/Linux)

- Clone this repository
- Switch to the `master` branch (the default is `develop` which might not be stable: `git checkout master`)
- `yarn` to install the dependencies (_not_ `npm i`!)
- `yarn start` to transpile the server, run the server on port 8080 and start the UI
- Open your browser on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## How to try it out (Windows)

Follow the steps in "How to run for development" below.

## How to run for development

- Clone this repository
- `yarn` to install the dependencies (_not_ `npm i`!)
- Open another terminal (you need two of those, and the order is important)
- `yarn start-ui` on the first terminal to run live Webpack with hot-reload
- `yarn start-server` on the second terminal to start the backend
- Open your browser on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## How to run for Production using Docker

### Prerequisites

You must have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed on your system.

### Result

This will install a production-ready version of Retrospected automatically, using Postgres. You don't need to have anything installed other than Docker. This will install and run:

- Postgres
- pgAdmin4 (Web UI for postgres)
- The Retrospected Nodejs backend
- The frontend, served by `nginx`.

### Installation

- Copy `docker-compose.yml.example` to `docker-compose.yml`
- Edit the file to set some passwords etc. You can also set your Google Analytics ID to enable Google Analytics tracking. You can also leave the file "as-is", it has sensible defaults.
- Run `docker-compose build`: this will build the backend and frontend images, based on your settings.
- Get yourself a coffee ☕️
- Run `docker-compose up -d`
- Voilà!

### Backups

When using the Docker deployment, your database runs from a container. But if you still need to make some backup of your data, you can do the following:

- Get the docker database image ID by doing: `docker ps`
- Run `` docker exec -t <docker_image_id> pg_dumpall -c -U postgres > dump_`date +%d-%m-%Y"_"%H_%M\_%S`.sql ``
- To restore your databases: `cat dump_1234.sql | docker exec -i <docker_image_id> psql -U postgres`

## How to run the tests

- Clone this repository
- `yarn` to install the dependencies (_not_ `npm i`!)
- `npm test` to run the tests
- **or** `yarn test-watch` to run the tests every time you change a file

## How to use Google Analytics

By default, Google Analytics is deactivated (it doesn't even get built into the bundle).

To enable it, you'll need to create a local `.env` file in `./retro-board-app/env.local` by copy-pasting the existing `.env` file in the same directory. To enable Google Analytics, simply add your GA Tracking ID like so: `REACT_APP_GA_ID=UA-&2345678-1`.

Note: Google Analytics only works when using the production webpack config (i.e. when `NODE_ENV` is set to `production`).

## How to use Postgres (w/o Docker)

By default, the database engine is NeDB, an in-process database with no external dependencies (i.e. no database to install on your system).

If you want to use a more "production-ready" database such as Postgres (without Docker), copy `.env.example` to `.env`, change `DB_TYPE` to `postgres` and fill the rest.

## How to debug

### Debugging the client

- Run both client and server normally (`yarn start-server` and `yarn start-ui`)
- From the browser window where the website is open, open the Chrome Dev tools
- Go on the **Sources** tab, and on the left, find your sources under `webpack://` and then `.`.
- You can then put breakpoints in there and debugging

## Roadmap

- Adding a real (but optional) login mechanism (Google/GitHub etc.)
- Highlight posts where the user voted

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### What if I want to name my session so I can remember easily how to come back to it?

You can actually change the session ID in the URL with anything you like: for example [www.retrospected.com/game/hello_world](http://www.retrospected.com/game/hello_world)

Try not to take a too common name though, to avoid anyone else finding your session by chance.
