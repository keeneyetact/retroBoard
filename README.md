Previous versions, up to v1.0.1 featured the following libraries:

- ~~[Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)~~
- ~~[CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)~~
- ~~[redux-saga](https://github.com/yelouafi/redux-saga)~~
- ~~[reselect](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect)~~
- ~~[ESLint](http://eslint.org/) for JS and JSX~~

## Prerequisites 💿

- `Yarn`: Please install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), as this mono-repo uses **Yarn Workspaces** which won't work with NPM.

## How to try it out (Mac / Linux) 🚀

- Clone this repository
- Switch to the `master` branch (the default is `develop` which might not be stable: `git checkout master`)
- `yarn` to install the dependencies (_not_ `npm i`!)
- `yarn start` to transpile the server, run the server on port 8080 and start the UI
- Open your browser on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## How to try it out (Windows) 🚀

Follow the steps in "How to run for development" below.

## How to run for development 📝

- Clone this repository
- `yarn` to install the dependencies (_not_ `npm i`!)
- Open another terminal (you need two of those, and the order is important)
- `yarn start-ui` on the first terminal to run live Webpack with hot-reload
- `yarn start-server` on the second terminal to start the backend
- Open your browser on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## How to run for Production using Docker 🐳

### Prerequisites

You must have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed on your system.

### Run 🚀

- Copy `docker-compose.example.yml` to `docker-compose.yml`
- Run `docker-compose up -d`
- Voilà!

This will run a production-ready version of Retrospected automatically, using Postgres. You don't need to have anything installed other than Docker. This will install and run:

- Postgres
- pgAdmin4 (Web UI for postgres)
- The Retrospected Nodejs backend
- The frontend, served by `nginx`.

### Backups 💾

When using the Docker deployment, your database runs from a container. But if you still need to make some backup of your data, you can do the following:

- Get the docker database image ID by doing: `docker ps`
- Run `` docker exec -t <docker_image_id> pg_dumpall -c -U postgres > dump_`date +%d-%m-%Y"_"%H_%M\_%S`.sql ``
- To restore your databases: `cat dump_1234.sql | docker exec -i <docker_image_id> psql -U postgres`

## How to run the tests ✅

- Clone this repository
- `yarn` to install the dependencies (_not_ `npm i`!)
- `npm test` to run the tests
- **or** `yarn test-watch` to run the tests every time you change a file

## How to use Postgres (w/o Docker) 🗄

By default, the database engine is NeDB, an in-process database with no external dependencies (i.e. no database to install on your system).

If you want to use a more "production-ready" database such as Postgres (without Docker), copy `.env.example` to `.env`, change `DB_TYPE` to `postgres` and fill the rest.

## Kubernetes ☸

To know more about Kubernetes, see the [readme](/k8s/readme.md) file in the `k8s` folder.

## How to debug

### Debugging the client

- Run both client and server normally (`yarn start-server` and `yarn start-ui`)
- From the browser window where the website is open, open the Chrome Dev tools
- Go on the **Sources** tab, and on the left, find your sources under `webpack://` and then `.`.
- You can then put breakpoints in there and debugging

## Roadmap and ideas 🚗 💡

- Highlight posts where the user voted
- Bluring posts to start with

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### What if I want to name my session so I can remember easily how to come back to it?

You can actually change the session ID in the URL with anything you like: for example [www.retrospected.com/game/hello_world](http://www.retrospected.com/game/hello_world)

Try not to take a too common name though, to avoid anyone else finding your session by chance.
